# JobQuest 1.0

## Inspiration
Job searching alone can be boring and exhausting, but getting our friends on board can make the process easier and more enjoyable for everyone.

## What it does
We are bringing to you **JobQuest**, a platform designed to make job searching more engaging and motivating. With **JobQuest**, you can create a party, invite your friends, and turn job applications into a friendly competition. The app sets daily goals for the number of applications you submit, and you and your friends compete to stay ahead in the race. You can track your progress on a game-inspired leaderboard and strive to win the weekly challenge. Job searching has never been this fun and interactive!

## How we built it
We built the frontend using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, leveraging **Figma** for design. Our backend is powered by **Python** and APIs, with **MongoDB** as our database. The project is deployed on **AWS**.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced challenges integrating the frontend with the backend. Additionally, implementing features within a limited time frame was challenging. Effectively and efficiently converting Figma designs into front-end development was also challenging. We designed the prototype in Figma while separately working on the coded website at the same time, so it was hard to combine them with the time limit.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have our product ready for submission. It has really cool designs and features that we are excited about!

## What we learned
We learned a lot of cool things! We worked with **Figma** to create interactive designs for our product, explored the magic of **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** for frontend development, and used **Python** and APIs for the backend.

## What's next for JobQuest
Our next quest will be to enhance interactivity in the game and make it more user-friendly. We plan to incorporate a reward system based on the number of job applications. Most importantly, we plan to support widgets on phones and Raspberry Pi-based digital frames for desks.
